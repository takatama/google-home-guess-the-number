A simple game to enjoy guessing the right number

## Full description
Guess the 3 digit number. Each digit should be a different number like 094. If you give me the number, I will give you a hint. If a digit and its position are correct, it will be a homerun. If a digit is correct but its position is wrong, it will be a hit. For example, if you say 492 and the correct answer is 094, I will give you a hint "one homerun, one hit".

You can change digit number. Please see the below sample invocation.
